  - Baseline methods degrade more rapidly
  
- **Panel C**: Dropout degradation (sensor failure resilience)
  - PEECOM's physics-informed features provide redundancy
  - Superior graceful degradation vs baselines
  
- **Panel D**: Expected Calibration Error (prediction reliability)
  - Lower ECE = better calibrated confidence
  - PEECOM provides more reliable uncertainty estimates

**Manuscript Claim**: "PEECOM demonstrates superior robustness across multiple stress conditions, maintaining high performance when baselines fail."

## Plot 4: Feature Engineering Contribution
**Files**: `plot_4_feature_engineering_contribution.png`

**Purpose**: Proves physics-informed features are the key advantage

**Key Evidence**:
- **Panel A**: Ablation study results
  - PEECOM_with_full_features vs MCF_with_full_features
  - PEECOM_features_on_MCF_classifier vs MCF_features_on_PEECOM_classifier
  - Demonstrates features matter more than classifier choice

- **Panel B**: Feature robustness comparison
  - Higher Ablation AUC = features provide better redundancy
  - PEECOM's physics features show superior robustness

**Manuscript Claim**: "The performance advantage stems from physics-informed feature engineering rather than classifier selection, contributing 6-11% improvement."

  - Baseline columns show more variability

- **Panel B**: F1-Score heatmap by target and model
  - Confirms accuracy results with balanced precision/recall
  - PEECOM maintains high F1 across all targets

**Manuscript Claim**: "PEECOM achieves consistent superior performance across all diagnostic targets, not just overall averages."
