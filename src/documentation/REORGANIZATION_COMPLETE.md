# PEECOM Project Structure Reorganization - Complete âœ…

## Summary of Changes

Your PEECOM/BLAST framework has been successfully reorganized with a clean, modular structure.

## Root Directory
**Clean and minimal** - Contains only essential execution files:
- `main.py` - Main execution entry point
- `compare_models.py` - Model comparison script  
- `src/` - All source code organized in subdirectories
- `dataset/`, `output/`, `Manuscript_Suite/` - Data and output directories (unchanged)

## Source Code Organization (`src/`)

### Core Framework (`src/models/`)
- `simple_peecom.py`, `enhanced_peecom.py` - Main PEECOM implementations
- `multi_classifier_peecom.py` - Multi-classifier variant
- ML model implementations (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)

### Analysis & Validation (`src/analysis/`)
- Statistical validation scripts
- Performance analysis tools
- Metrics analyzers
- Novelty validators

### Experiments (`src/experiments/`)
- Robustness testing
- Cross-validation experiments  
- Comparison studies with other methods

### Visualization (`src/visualization/`)
- All plotting and visualization code
- Framework schematics
- Publication-quality plots
- Dashboard components

### Utilities (`src/utils/`, `src/scripts/`)
- Core utilities (training, parsing, results handling)
- Generation and preprocessing scripts
- Enhancement tools

### Documentation (`src/documentation/`)
- All markdown files organized in one place
- Technical documentation
- Analysis summaries
- Implementation guides

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns** - Each directory has a specific purpose
2. **Easy Navigation** - Find files quickly based on their function
3. **Clean Root** - Only essential execution files at top level
4. **Scalable** - Easy to add new components in appropriate directories
5. **Professional** - Standard project organization following best practices

## Usage

```bash
# Run main analysis
python main.py

# Compare models  
python compare_models.py

# Execute full pipeline
bash src/run.sh

# Work with specific components
cd src/analysis    # for analysis scripts
cd src/experiments # for validation experiments
cd src/visualization # for plotting
```

Your workspace is now clean, organized, and ready for efficient development! ðŸŽ‰
