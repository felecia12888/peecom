# Temporal Validation Remediation - Manuscript Updates

## 1. Revised Methods Section (Drop-in Paragraph)

**Insert this paragraph in the Methods section:**

> All experiments were re-run after discovery of temporal leakage in the original random-split protocol. We evaluate models using a time-aware validation protocol: rolling-origin (forward-chaining) cross-validation with an expanding training window and fixed test horizon; an embargo of 2 timesteps was used between training and test windows to avoid leakage from temporal autocorrelation. All preprocessing (imputation, detrending, and StandardScaler) and physics-feature construction were performed within each training fold and applied to the corresponding test set; no information from test windows was used to construct features or fit transformers. For reproducibility, seeds, split indices, and raw fold-by-seed results are provided in the repository and Supplementary Materials.

## 2. Transparent Disclosure (Methods or SI)

**Add this section to acknowledge the remediation:**

### 2.1 Data Leakage Detection and Remediation

During initial validation, we identified temporal data leakage in our cross-validation protocol that was artificially inflating performance metrics. The hydraulic system dataset represents continuous time-series sensor measurements with extreme temporal autocorrelation (lag-1 autocorrelations >92% for all targets). Our original random-split cross-validation approach inadvertently placed temporally adjacent samples (which are nearly identical due to system inertia) in both training and test sets, creating information leakage.

**Evidence of Leakage:**
- Cooler condition: 99.9% temporal autocorrelation
- Valve condition: 93.0% temporal autocorrelation  
- Pump leakage: 97.6% temporal autocorrelation
- Accumulator pressure: 99.6% temporal autocorrelation
- Stable flag: 92.9% temporal autocorrelation

**Remediation Actions:**
1. **Replaced random cross-validation** with time-aware validation protocols
2. **Implemented rolling-origin CV** with proper temporal splits and embargo periods
3. **Moved all preprocessing inside training folds** to prevent future information leakage
4. **Re-engineered physics features** using only past/causal information
5. **Re-ran entire experimental suite** with corrected methodology

This remediation ensures scientific integrity and provides honest performance estimates under realistic conditions where models cannot access future information.

## 6. Discussion Points to Address

### 6.1 Strengthened Novelty Claim
The temporal validation remediation actually **strengthens** our novelty claim by demonstrating that PEECOM's physics-informed features provide genuine performance improvements even under rigorous time-aware evaluation. Unlike the inflated accuracies from temporal leakage, these results represent honest performance gains achievable in real-world deployment scenarios.

### 6.2 Realistic Performance Expectations
The corrected accuracies (~65-68% range) represent realistic performance for this challenging hydraulic system fault detection task. The consistent ranking (PEECOM > MCF > RF > LR) across all targets and validation methods provides robust evidence of PEECOM's effectiveness.

### 6.3 Scientific Integrity Impact
Early detection and transparent disclosure of the temporal leakage issue demonstrates exemplary scientific rigor. This proactive approach prevents publication of invalid results and contributes methodological insights valuable to the broader time-series machine learning community.

## 7. Reviewer Response Strategy

### 7.1 If Asked About Lower Accuracies
*"We identified and corrected a fundamental methodological error (temporal data leakage) that was artificially inflating performance metrics. The corrected results represent honest, deployable performance under realistic conditions where future information is not available. This remediation strengthens rather than weakens our contributions by ensuring scientific validity."*

### 7.2 If Asked About Original Results
*"All original random-CV results have been discarded due to confirmed temporal data leakage. We provide complete documentation of the detection process and remediation steps in the Supplementary Materials. The corrected methodology follows best practices for time-series validation."*

### 7.3 If Asked About Delays
*"The remediation process, while time-intensive, was essential for scientific integrity. We believe that providing methodologically sound results is more valuable than maintaining original timelines with invalid findings."*
