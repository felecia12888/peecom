"""
Create PERFECTLY homogeneous synthetic data for pipeline validation
==================================================================

This generates data where:
1. ALL features have IDENTICAL statistical properties across blocks
2. Classes are randomly assigned (no block-class correlation)
3. Block membership is indistinguishable from feature values alone

This is the true "clean" control for validating our leakage detection pipeline.
